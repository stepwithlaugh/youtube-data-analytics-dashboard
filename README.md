# YouTube Data Science Channels Analysis  

This project dives into **8 popular YouTube channels** in the Data Science & Analytics space, combining **Python + Tableau** to collect, clean, enrich, and visualize their performance data.

- **Data Collection (Python/Jupyter)**:  
  - Uses the YouTube API to pull channel and video metadata  
  - Main analysis in: `youtube_analysis.ipynb`  

- **Data Cleaning & Enrichment**:  
  - Three key datasets:  
    - `channels_clean.csv` ‚Äì high-level channels info  
    - `videos_clean.csv` ‚Äì detailed video data for each upload  
    - `features_clean.csv` ‚Äì calculated KPIs like views/day, engagement rates, and content topics  

- **Visualization (Tableau)**:  
  - Interactive dashboard covering:
    - Channel growth and performance trends  
    - YouTube Shorts vs. Longform content breakdown  
    - Topic popularity heatmap  
    - Key metrics: views per day, engagement rates, upload frequency, and audience reach  

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/youtube_analysis.ipynb`) to explore the full data pipeline  
3. Review the cleaned datasets in `/data/` (ready for analysis or visualization)  
4. Open the Tableau workbook or view the dashboard live on Tableau Public  


## üìå Data Notes

- I handpicked channels with roughly 1M+ subscribers (or close to it)  
- Analysis covers **videos uploaded in the last 12 months**  
- All data is publicly available through the YouTube API  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas, requests, YouTube API)  
- **Tableau** (for visualizations)  
- CSV data files  

## ‚ú® What's Next?

Some ideas I'm considering for future versions:
- Expand to more channels or explore other niches (AI research, software development, etc.)  
- Track performance "velocity" with time-series snapshots (T+1, T+7 views)  
- Analyze how video length, posting schedule, or thumbnail design affects engagement
